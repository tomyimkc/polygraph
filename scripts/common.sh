# This "ci" work package (.github/workflows/ + scripts/) does not own
# kernels/, tools/, tests/, mcp/, or docs/ — those are built by other agents
# working in this repo concurrently. To avoid a hard dependency on file names
# that may not exist yet (or may land with a slightly different name), every
# stage below is a *best-effort dispatcher*: it searches an ordered list of
# candidate entrypoints and runs the first one it finds. If none exist yet,
# the stage is recorded as SKIPPED (not failed, not passed) so CI stays green
# during development and automatically starts exercising real code the moment
# a matching file lands — no CI edit required.
#
# Expected entrypoints (first match wins), all resolved relative to the repo
# root:

# If your tool needs a different name, either rename to match one of the
# candidates above, or add it to the relevant `find_entrypoint` call in
# scripts/lib/*.sh — those are the only places the candidate lists live.
#
# Contract for verify_dispatch / bench invocations: this file's
# run_entrypoint() always passes MODEL, LLAMA_CLI, THREADS, OUTPUT_DIR as
# environment variables (see scripts/lib/verify_dispatch.sh and
# scripts/lib/run_bench.sh) rather than assuming a fixed CLI flag spelling,
# since flags are cheaper for a tool author to read from env than for this
# dispatcher to guess.
#
# IMPORTANT correctness note for anyone implementing tools/verify_dispatch:
# llama-cli defaults to offloading layers to the GPU backend (Metal on
# macOS) when one is compiled in. The KleidiAI CPU dispatch under test in
# Finding 1 only executes when computation actually runs on the CPU backend.
# The verified reproduction this repo is built on used exactly this
# invocation (see docs / README for the full write-up):
#   llama-cli -m MODEL -p "..." -n 16 -no-cnv -st --simple-io -t N
# and got the expected thread-gated hit counts on the CPU backend without
# passing -ngl, on this specific 0.5B model. If you change the model, the
# backend build flags, or add GPU layers, re-verify the CPU path is actually
# what is being measured before trusting a hit count of 0 as "gated" rather
# than "not running on CPU at all".
