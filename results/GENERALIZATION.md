# Generalization: does this hold beyond one 0.5B/Q4_0 model?

> **Honest headline verdict.** Two of three questions generalize cleanly. The third does

## 0. Setup

**Models** (all Apache-2.0, license verified **live** against the HF API immediately before
use, not read from `scripts/models.txt`'s comments):

| model_id (`scripts/models.txt`) | HF repo | file | bytes (real download) | sha256 | license (live HF API) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-0.5b-q4_0` | Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF | qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q4_0.gguf | 347,023,872 (existing, `/tmp/ggufs/q05.gguf`) | `7671c0c3...edaf6ed` (pre-existing, not re-verified this session) | apache-2.0 |
| `qwen2.5-1.5b-q4_0` | Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF | qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_0.gguf | 1,066,227,232 | `dcd819ff094852c38faba6873d8ff0c9d51eadb2844539e52042ae5d647bbfdb` — **matches manifest exactly** | apache-2.0 (`cardData.license`, checked live via `curl -s https://huggingface.co/api/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF`) |
| `qwen2.5-0.5b-q8_0` | Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-GGUF | qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf | 675,710,816 | `ca59ca7f13d0e15a8cfa77bd17e65d24f6844b554a7b6c12e07a5f89ff76844e` — **matches manifest exactly** | apache-2.0 (same repo/card as the Q4_0 row) |

`Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF` also publishes a `qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf` file (confirmed
present via the HF API's `siblings` list this session), which would give a full 2x2
(size x quant) grid. It was **not** fetched or measured — it is not yet in
`scripts/models.txt` (this work package's file scope is `results/GENERALIZATION.md` and
`tools/crossover.py` only, not `scripts/models.txt`), and the two axes below (0.5B->1.5B at
fixed Q4_0, Q4_0->Q8_0 at fixed 0.5B) already separate the size question from the quant
question cleanly. Flagged here as the obvious next cell if a future session wants the full grid.

**Binaries**, both `dbadb68` (this repo's pinned commit), `-DGGML_CPU_KLEIDIAI=ON
-DGGML_METAL=OFF`, Release, confirmed via `llama-cli --version` this session:
- baseline: `/tmp/llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-cli` — unmodified, matches `results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`'s baseline exactly.
- autodefault: `/tmp/llama-autodefaults/build/bin/llama-cli` — `dbadb68` +
  `patches/0002-kleidiai-sme-aware-thread-default.patch`, matches `results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`'s
  autodefault binary exactly.

**Host**: Apple M4 Max, same machine as every other result in this repo. `sme_thread_cap = 2`
(hardcoded per-brand-string lookup, see `results/GROUND-TRUTH-DISPATCH.md` — does not depend on
model size or quant, so it is unchanged across every measurement below).

**Contention, stated plainly.** This session ran while other agents worked on this same repo
concurrently, as the work package brief warned. The 1-minute load average was observed
swinging from **5 to 195** on this 16-core host over the course of this session (`uptime`
snapshots below are real, not illustrative):

```
15:24  load averages: 21.18 46.38 33.31
15:48  load averages: 174.87 125.86 84.41
15:55  load averages: 195.42 157.75 113.61   <- peak observed
16:01  load averages: 151.70 155.50 128.77
16:10  load averages: 5.03 32.91 73.22
16:14  load averages: 4.64 17.76 56.81
```

A full `--threads 1,2,4,8,16 --sme-modes on,off` sweep (the shape used in
`results/crossover/crossover-apple-m4-max.md`) was attempted first for the 1.5B model, hit the
~195 load spike, and was deliberately **stopped and re-scoped** (`--sme-modes on` only,
`--skip-split-phase`, `--decode-n-gen`/`--prefill-n-prompt` halved, `--retries 1`) rather than
left to run for a potentially unbounded time — every number below that used this reduced scope
says so at point of use. All comparisons that matter for this document's verdict (thread-count
rankings, patch-vs-baseline ratios) are **within-run, round-robin-interleaved comparisons**,
which this repo's own established convention (see `results/crossover/crossover-apple-m4-max.md`'s
own contention note) treats as far more contention-robust than any single absolute tok/s number.
Every table below states its own `n`; nothing here claims `results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`-level
statistical weight where it doesn't have it.

**Tooling.** `tools/crossover.py` gained a new `--autodefault-compare` mode this session (see
`tools/crossover.md`'s sibling doc-comment in the script itself), which generalizes
`results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`'s hand-run 4-config round-robin protocol (baseline no-flags /
autodefault no-flags / baseline `-t <cap>` hand-tuned / autodefault kill-switch) to any
`--model` + any pair of `--baseline-bin-dir` / `--autodefault-bin-dir`, driven entirely by
existing/refactored helpers (`run_llama_cli_config_once`, a generalization of the pre-existing
`run_llama_cli_split_once` that is kept as a thin wrapper so its behavior is unchanged). No
existing CLI flag's default behavior changed; regression-tested against the original
`--model`/`--llama-bin-dir` main-sweep path with matching output before/after the edit.

---

## 1. Does `patches/0002` still win? By how much?

Same protocol as `results/AUTODEFAULTS.md` section 5 (round-robin 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,...,
prefill+decode from one `llama-cli` invocation's `[ Prompt: X t/s | Generation: Y t/s ]` line),
now run via `tools/crossover.py --autodefault-compare`, **n=9** for both new models (matching
`results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`'s own n=9), 0 retries needed, 0 measurement errors on either run.

Prompt real-token-count independently re-verified via `llama-tokenize` at runtime (never
assumed): 261 tokens for both new-model runs (260-word synthetic prompt).

### Reading it

| ratio | 0.5B/Q4_0 (reference) | 1.5B/Q4_0 (new) | 0.5B/Q8_0 (new) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| decode: autodefault / baseline-no-flags | **2.15x** | **1.47x** | **3.00x** |
| decode: autodefault / hand-tuned `-t 2` | 0.999x | 0.989x | 0.997x |
| decode: kill-switch / baseline-no-flags | 1.007x | 1.032x | 1.032x |
| prefill: autodefault / baseline-no-flags | 0.970x | 0.948x | 0.962x |
| prefill: naive `-t 2` / baseline-no-flags | **0.532x (collapse)** | **0.577x (collapse)** | **1.123x (no collapse)** |
| prefill: kill-switch / baseline-no-flags | 1.000x | 1.003x | 1.050x |

**Generalizes cleanly:** the mechanism itself. In every model/quant tested, "autodefault,
no flags" lands within 1.1-1.3% of "baseline, hand-tuned `-t <cap>`" — the patch reaches
whatever the SME-cap thread count achieves, automatically, every time. The kill switch
(`GGML_KLEIDIAI_AUTO_THREADS=0`) reproduces the unpatched baseline within noise in every case
(1.00x-1.05x). Prefill stays within a tight -3% to -5% band of baseline in every case — "prefill
roughly unchanged" also generalizes.

**Does not generalize identically:** the *magnitude* of the win, and — more importantly — the
justification for the patch's phase-aware design. The decode win ranges from 1.47x to 3.00x
across these three configs, not a fixed constant. And the "naive `-t 2` collapses prefill"
argument — one of the two reasons `patches/0002` needed to be phase-aware rather than a blanket
`-t 2` recommendation — **does not hold for Q8_0**: at 0.5B/Q8_0, `-t 2` alone (no `-tb`) does
**not** collapse prefill; it is statistically indistinguishable from or slightly above the
no-flags baseline (1.12x, though this cell's stddev is wide — see caveat below). The collapse is
real and reproduces at both sizes for **Q4_0** (0.53x, 0.58x) but is not a universal KleidiAI
property; it is Q4_0-specific on this hardware. The patch's phase-aware design is therefore still
the right call (it is a strict improvement or a no-op in every case, never a regression), but the
specific failure mode it was built to avoid is narrower than "any low thread count on any quant."

---

## 2. Does the decode thread-scaling shape hold, or change with model size?

Cleanest available signal: `llama-bench` pure-decode calls (`-p 0 -n 64`, isolated, no
preceding prefill in the same process — the same tool `tools/crossover.py`'s main sweep uses),
round-robin interleaved across `threads={1,2,4,8}`, **n=5** each, run back-to-back today at low
contention (`uptime` load average 4.6-17.8 for this specific set of measurements).

| threads | 0.5B/Q4_0 decode t/s | 0.5B/Q8_0 decode t/s | 1.5B/Q4_0 decode t/s |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 200.5 (±1.60) | 212.3 (±3.38) | 57.0 (±0.20) |
| 2 | **317.5** (±3.68) **<- optimum** | **327.0** (±3.31) **<- optimum** | 103.9 (±0.68) |
| 4 | 273.3 (±2.22) | 214.6 (±3.10) | **122.1** (±0.56) **<- optimum** |
| 8 | 158.6 (±1.38) | 139.6 (±2.53) | 98.9 (±0.25) |

(stdev is tight and non-overlapping between the top two thread counts in every column — this is
not noise-dominated the way an earlier, heavily-contended full sweep in
`results/crossover/crossover-apple-m4-max.md` was, see that file's own superseded-note.)

**Verdict: the shape does NOT fully generalize.** At 0.5B, regardless of quant (Q4_0 or Q8_0),
decode throughput peaks at **exactly `threads=2`, the SME thread cap** — the assumption
`patches/0002` is built on. At 1.5B/Q4_0, decode throughput peaks at **`threads=4`**, beating
`threads=2` by **17.5%** (122.1 vs 103.9 t/s), even though — confirmed independently in section 3
below — SME2 itself **does not dispatch** at 4 threads for decode on any of these models; the
kernel executing at `threads=4` is the plain NEON `dotprod` kernel, not SME2. So the *direction*
of "fewer threads beat the naive full-core default" still holds everywhere (all of 1/2/4 beat
`threads=8`, which is already worse than the SME2 thread count in every column) — but the
*specific* optimal thread count that `patches/0002` hardcodes to (the SME cap) is not the true
per-model optimum once the model is bigger. `patches/0002`'s current mechanism has no way to
select `threads=4` for the 1.5B case; it always picks the SME cap regardless of model.

### A methodological caveat this session could not fully resolve

An **end-to-end** measurement (`llama-cli`, one real prefill of a 260-word prompt immediately
followed by decode, `-t` applied to both phases since no `-tb` was passed — i.e. exactly how
`results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`'s own config 3 and this document's section 1 above measure
"hand-tuned") gives a **different** ranking for 0.5B/Q4_0 than the isolated `llama-bench`
measurement above: `-t 4` (245.0 t/s decode, stdev 2.56, n=5) measurably beat `-t 2` (198.4 t/s,
stdev 3.80, n=5) in that end-to-end mode, even though isolated `llama-bench` decode-only calls
show the opposite ranking for the same model (317.5 @ t=2 vs 273.3 @ t=4, tabulated above). Both
measurements are internally clean (tight, non-overlapping stddev) — this is not one noisy number
outvoting a clean one. The most plausible explanation not yet independently confirmed this
session: in the end-to-end path, a heavier `-t 4` prefill immediately precedes decode in the
same process (frequency/thermal state, cache occupancy, or thread-pool warm-up carrying over),
while the isolated `llama-bench` call never runs a prefill at all. This was **not** controlled
for or resolved here — it is reported as an open discrepancy, not swept under the rug, because
it directly bears on how much to trust any single-call "hand-tuned ceiling" claim (including
`results/AUTODEFAULTS.md`'s own `-t 2` ceiling for 0.5B/Q4_0, which used the end-to-end style).
The section 1 table above is still valid on its own terms (patch reaches its own `-t <cap>`
target, matching a hand-tuned run of the *same config*, in the *same end-to-end mode*) — what's
genuinely unresolved is whether `-t <cap>` is the best *achievable* end-to-end config for every
model, or only the best one anyone measured.

---

## 3. Does SME2 dispatch behave the same way?

`tools/verify_dispatch.py --threads 1,2,4,8,16 --workloads all` (unmodified tool, both new
models), baseline binary. L3 (the decisive dispatch layer — an `lldb` regex breakpoint on
`kai_run_matmul_*`, hit-counting the real inference run, not the selection log) for both:

| model | threads | decode_short verdict | decode hits (advertised/other) | prefill_long verdict | prefill hits (advertised/other) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| **1.5B/Q4_0** | 1 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 1176/0 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 781/0 |
| | 2 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 8064/0 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 5352/0 |
| | 4 | SILENT_FALLBACK | 0/18816 (dotprod) | SME2_HYBRID_DISPATCH | 2673/7815 (dotprod) |
| | 8 | SILENT_FALLBACK | 0/37632 (dotprod) | SME2_HYBRID_DISPATCH | 3071/17024 (dotprod) |
| | 16 | SILENT_FALLBACK | 0/75263 (dotprod) | SME2_HYBRID_DISPATCH | 2776/32009 (dotprod) |
| **0.5B/Q8_0** | 1 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 1014/0 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 672/0 |
| | 2 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 5952/0 | SME2_DISPATCHED | 3937/0 |
| | 4 | SILENT_FALLBACK | 0/16222 (dotprod) | SME2_HYBRID_DISPATCH | 3080/6042 (**i8mm**) |
| | 8 | DOTPROD_EXECUTED_NO_ADVERTISED_FEATURE\* | 0/32443 (dotprod) | SME2_HYBRID_DISPATCH | 2631/12885 (**i8mm**) |
| | 16 | DOTPROD_EXECUTED_NO_ADVERTISED_FEATURE\* | 0/52219 (dotprod) | I8MM_EXECUTED_NO_ADVERTISED_FEATURE\* | 0/23332 (**i8mm**) |

\* At these three cells the L2 (SELECT, log-scraping) probe **timed out under contention and was
killed** (`returncode=-9` at the 60s L2 timeout — confirmed by reading the raw ledger JSON) while
this session had a second heavy sweep running concurrently. L1 and **L3 (the decisive layer)**
completed normally and are reported above unaffected; only the "advertised" L2 log line is
missing for those three cells, which is why the verdict label says `NO_ADVERTISED_FEATURE`
rather than `SILENT_FALLBACK`/`SME2_HYBRID_DISPATCH` — the tool is correctly reporting what it
could and could not observe, not fabricating an L2 line. The L3 dispatch pattern itself is
identical in shape to the surrounding cells (dotprod for decode, i8mm for prefill), so this is
read as a measurement gap, not a real dispatch difference.

**Verdict: generalizes cleanly, on both axes.** The exact rule from
`results/GROUND-TRUTH-DISPATCH.md` (SME2 dispatches when `n_threads <= sme_thread_cap`; above
that, decode collapses to the plain NEON kernel while prefill can still reach a *hybrid*
SME2+NEON path when `ne11 >= 128`) reproduces **exactly**, cell for cell, on both a 3.5x larger
model (1.5B/Q4_0) and a different quant (0.5B/Q8_0). The only quant-dependent detail is *which*
NEON-family kernel fills the non-SME2 slot: `dotprod` for Q4_0 (both sizes), **`i8mm`** for
Q8_0 — a real, KleidiAI-native, quant-specific kernel choice (see `classify_symbol_family()` in
`tools/verify_dispatch.py`), not a bug or an inconsistency. This makes sense mechanically: the
dispatch gate lives in `ggml/src/ggml-cpu/kleidiai/kleidiai.cpp` and is a function of
`n_threads`, `ne11` (batch size), and `ne01/n_threads` alone — it has no dependency on model
depth/width or tensor quant type, so there was no *architectural* reason to expect this to break,
and it didn't.

---

## 4. Summary

| question | generalizes? | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Does `patches/0002` still win vs. the no-flags baseline? | **Yes, everywhere tested** (1.47x-3.00x decode) | §1 |
| Does autodefault reach its own hand-tuned `-t <cap>` target? | **Yes, everywhere tested** (0.989x-0.999x) | §1 |
| Does the "naive `-t 2` collapses prefill" justification hold? | **No — Q4_0-specific**, not general | §1 |
| Does decode's optimal thread count stay pinned to the SME cap? | **No — holds at 0.5B (both quants), breaks at 1.5B** (`t=4` beats `t=2` by 17.5%) | §2 |
| Does SME2's dispatch *rule* (gate, hybrid path, family choice) generalize? | **Yes, cleanly, cell-for-cell** | §3 |

The one-sentence version: **`patches/0002` is a real, robust, portable win over doing nothing —
it is not a 0.5B-only artifact — but it is not tuned to the true per-model optimum, and this
session found a concrete, reproducible case (1.5B) where a smarter default would do measurably
better than "always use the SME cap."** That is a legitimate scope-for-future-work finding, not
a reason to distrust the core result: nowhere in this session did the patch regress relative to
the unpatched baseline, and the kill switch reproduced the baseline within noise in every single
test.
